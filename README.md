## About me: 
I am a fullstack software engineer with experience in Ruby on Rails, Python, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, jQuery, CSS, SQL, PostgreSQL, Git and GitHub.

After a brief career pause to care for my family, I decided to upskill and refresh my tech stack. I'm now wrapping up a Software Engineering Fellowship at Hackbright Academy and am thrilled to dive back into the world of coding. I'm excited to connect with you about any remote or Bay Area SWE opportunities!

On a personal note, I am a home brewer, a ceramic artist (specialties include alternative firing techniques, and Kintsugi - the Japanese art of repairing ceramics with gold).  I bake, collect mineral specimens and meteorites, and am always looking for opportunities to expand my horizons- whether it is traveling to new cultures, learning new crafts or specialties (did I mention I am a PADI certified Shark Conservation Specialist?), or pushing my own boundaries with activities like sky diving or SCUBA. Oh yeah, and 99% of the photos on my phone are of my dog doing silly things.  If you ask to see some, I will send a ridiculous number.
